        Self-care is the intentional practice of looking after your mental, emotional,
        <br /> and physical health. It&apos;s more than occasional indulgenceâ€”it&apos;s about creating
        <br /> a lifestyle that prioritizes your well-being and helps you function at your best.
        <br /> In today&apos;s demanding world, self-care is essential for maintaining
        <br /> balance, reducing stress, and fostering personal growth.
