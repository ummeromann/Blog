  <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold sm:text-4xl md:text-4xl mt-10">Challenges to Reconnecting with Nature</h1>
  <p className="pt-3 text-lg sm:text-base md:text-lg items-center justify-center">
  <strong>1. Urbanization</strong>
  <br/>
  Limited access to green spaces in cities can make it difficult to interact with nature.

  Solution: Seek out community parks, rooftop gardens, or balcony gardening.
  <br/>
  <strong>2. Busy Lifestyles</strong>
  <br/>
  Hectic schedules often leave little time for outdoor activities.
  <br/>
  Solution: Incorporate nature into daily routines, like taking a morning walk or eating lunch outside.
  <br/> 
  <strong>3. Digital Distractions</strong>
  <br/>
  Constant engagement with screens can create a disconnect from the natural world.
  <br/>
  Solution: Set aside specific “nature time” each week to unplug and recharge.
  </p>
